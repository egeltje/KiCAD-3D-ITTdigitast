# KiCAD-3D-ITTdigitast
A 3D model of the ITT cannon digitast switch

Ever since I saw this switch in the Elex (a junior edition of Elektor back in the days), I was in love with its elegance.
I recently switched from Eagle to KiCAD and decided to model these switches so I can use them in my designs.

The body of the switch is the same in every configuration. The caps can change. Depending on the cap, LED's can be added to the body.

This repository contains KiCAD footprints and 3D models for the switches.

For now, the caps are red. I plan to make all models also in different colors.
